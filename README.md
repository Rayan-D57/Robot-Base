Robot Base Design Project

Description:
This project involves the design and implementation of a robot base that can be used in various applications such as automated navigation and motion control. The base is designed to be robust and flexible, with the ability to adapt to different types of terrain and tasks.

Main Components:
- Basic structure: A strong and durable structure made of lightweight materials such as aluminum or reinforced plastic.
- Motors: Geared motors to ensure smooth and precise movement.
- Wheels or feet: Depending on the application, wheels can be used for smooth surfaces or feet for rough surfaces.
- Sensors: Such as ultrasonic sensors and gyroscopes to improve navigation and avoid obstacles.
